# Substance Usage Tracker App

My first personal project in progress,  using SQLite database, Dapper, MS.Extensions.Configuration -> for connectionStrings. Written in C#.

## My vision // Tasks to do

- [x] Work and write a code where the user will have to use DateTime format.
  - [x] Validations.
- [ ] The user shouldn't input the day of the session if(Not Admin for now).
  - [ ] The App should calculate one month average dosing values! -> CalculateAvg method.
- [ ] The user will be able to input the values including Quantity or DateTime, manually through change records method, which will be only in one version of this app.
- [x] Try to learn markdown aside from doing this App.
